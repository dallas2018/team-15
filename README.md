## Roadblocks
- Trying to recreate TypeForm, we wanted to seamlessly transition to the next question without the user "clicking" - trigger when the user hit enter. Solution:
    ```javascript
    onKeyDown="if(event.keyCode==13) location.href='#apply3';"
    ```

   Change `http://resources.infolinks.com/js/infolinks_main.js` to `//resources.infolinks.com/js/infolinks_main.js` or `httpS://resources.infolinks.com/js/infolinks_main.js`
